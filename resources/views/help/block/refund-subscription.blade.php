            <p>You can request a refund anytime during the first period of your subscription. There are a few factors in-which decide what happens.</p>
            <ul class="mb-2">
                <li>
                    <mark>Every subscription refund is up to the discretion of the server owner</mark>, however if the shop says "No Questions Asked" and you are within their refund policy time-frame listed when your request is submitted, rest assured they will refund.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the server owner fails to refund the server owner can be punished. You can contact us at support@beastlybot.com<br>
                    </li> 
                </ul>     
                <li>         
                    However, if the refund policy is "by server owner discretion with reason" you can request anytime during your subscriptions first billing term with a reason. Your best luck is to request during their refund policy timeline.<br>
                </li>                
                <li>
                    If the server has no refund policy (or you are outside the refund policy), you can request a refund at any time during the subscriptions first billing term with a reason.
                </li>
            </ul>      
            <p><mark>The Beastly Bot cannot issue a refund for the server owner. Please trust who you are paying!</mark></p>    
            <p class="font-weight-100">You cannot cancel a refund request. After issued, you will be removed immediately from the role. Refunds can take up to 10 days to make it back to your bank.

        <h2 class="title">BeastlyBot Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At BeastlyBot, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
        <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
        <li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
        <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
        <h3 id="whoweareandwhatthispolicycovers">Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
        <p>BeastlyBot is membership bot platform designed to allow anyone – from bloggers, to podcasters, small business owners, and enterprises – to build and manage membership bots for Discord. These membership bots allow charging a subscription fee in order to access private Discord channels and supergroups. Our mission is to democratize publishing and community management. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Our website (<a href="https://beastly.app">beastly.app</a>);</li>
        <li>Our Discord bot (<a href="https://discord.com/BeastlyBot">@BeastlyBot</a>);</li>
        <li>Other user’s membership Discord bots that use our Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website and Discord bots collectively as “Services.” And if you’d like to learn more about which BeastlyBot company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
        <h3 id="creativecommonssharealikelicense">Creative Commons Sharealike License</h3>
        <p>This document is based upon the Automattic Privacy Policy and is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a>. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse BeastlyBot or its use of the work.</p>
        <h3 id="informationwecollect">Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
        <h4 id="_informationyouprovidetous_"><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
        <p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Membership Bot Information:</strong> If you use our Services to sell products or services to others through your membership bot built with BeastlyBot, you will have to create an BeastlyBot project (or several) and provide us with some information to make your membership bot work. This may include project name, description, resources (like private Discord channels and supergroups), subscription plans (names, description, prices, included resources). You may also provide us with some extra information information about your account at 3rd-party payment provider to set up an integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Information:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your membership bot). For example, if you write your membership bot description that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet. This might be obvious to you…but it’s not to everyone!</li>
        <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your Discord bot (API token) and your payment provider accounts. </li>
        <li><strong>Communications With Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our team about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="_informationwecollectautomatically_"><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>
        <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you browse our website or create/make changes to your membership bots with <a href="https://discord.com/BeastlyBot">@BeastlyBot</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that membership bot administrators and users perform–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on our website, our Discord bot (<a href="https://discord.com/BeastlyBot">@BeastlyBot</a>) or membership bots built with BeastlyBot (e.g., [Discord user ID] created a new subscription plan “[title of plan]” at [time/date]).. We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
        <li><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. BeastlyBot uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. <!--For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="http://beastly.app/">Cookie Policy</a>.--></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="_informationwecollectfromothersources_"><em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em></h4>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord Profile:</strong> When you open <a href="https://discord.beastly.app">discord.beastly.app</a> (or one of our user`s membership bot shops for the first time) or log in using Discord Login Widget on our website, we collect information about your Discord profile that we receive from Discord. This includes your Discord user ID and may include your first and last name, username and language code. </li>
        <li><strong>Payment providers:</strong> We may also get information from payment providers that you integrate with BeastlyBot in order to accept payments from your users with your membership bot. For example, if you connect your payment provider account (like Stripe via Stripe Connect), we will receive information from that service (such as API keys, account ID) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="informationwedonotcollect">Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> BeastlyBot does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world (like Stripe). It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither BeastlyBot nor Discord have access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from BeastlyBot. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="howandwhyweuseinformation">How And Why We Use Information</h3>
        <h4 id="_purposesforusinginformation_"><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>
        <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>To provide our Services–for example, to set up, host and maintain your membership bot, backup and restore your membership bot, or charge you for any of our paid Services;</li>
        <li>To further develop and improve our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their membership bots more efficiently;</li>
        <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
        <li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition--for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;</li>
        <li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of BeastlyBot and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by BeastlyBot and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on BeastlyBot and our products; and</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="_legalbasesforcollectingandusinginformation_"><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></h4>
        <p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account--for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information--for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.</p>
        <h3 id="sharinginformation">Sharing Information</h3>
        <h4 id="_howweshareinformation_"><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>
        <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
        <li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BeastlyBot, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that BeastlyBot goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your membership bot through our features.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="_informationsharedpublicly_"><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></h4>
        <p>Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your membership bot name, URL and description, set of subscription plans with names, prices and list of included benefits, are all available to others–and we hope you get a lot of users! Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>
        <h3 id="howlongwekeepinformation">How Long We Keep Information</h3>
        <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of BeastlyBot’s websites, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to BeastlyBot’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>
        <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
        <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable advanced security settings, like <a href="https://Discord.com/blog/sessions-and-2-step-verification">Two Step Authentication in Discord</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
        <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Limit the Information that You Provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services–for example, payment integrations–may not be accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> At this time, BeastlyBot does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using BeastlyBot’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of BeastlyBot’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your BeastlyBot account. To do that, delete all the projects you've created with @BeastlyBot. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above--for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="yourrights">Your Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
        <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
        <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
        <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
        <h3 id="controllerandresponsiblecompany">Controller and Responsible Company</h3>
        <p><strong>BeastlyBot LLC</strong> </p>
        <h3 id="howtoreachus">How to Reach Us</h3>
        <p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please <a href="mailto:team@beastly.app">contact us</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="otherthingsyoushouldknowkeepreading">Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h3>
        <h4 id="_transferringinformation_"><em>Transferring Information</em></h4>
        <p>Because BeastlyBot’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>; or</li>
        <li>In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.</p>
        <h4 id="_adsandanalyticsservicesprovidedbyothers_"><em>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</em></h4>
        <p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by BeastlyBot and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
        <h4 id="_thirdparties_"><em>Third Parties</em></h4>
        <p>Please note that BeastlyBot uses some 3-rd party software and services. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information, which you should review. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>BeastlyBot uses Discord:</strong> Please refer to <a href="https://Discord.com/privacy">Discord Privacy Policy</a>. </li>
        <li><strong>BeastlyBot uses Google Analytics and G Suite:</strong> Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=ZZ">Google Privacy Policy</a>. </li>
        <li><strong>BeastlyBot uses Google Cloud Service:</strong> Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=ZZ">Google Privacy Policy</a>. </li>
        <li><strong>BeastlyBot uses Stripe:</strong> Please refer to <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>. </li>
        <li><strong>Other 3rd-parties:</strong> If you’d like to use other third party plugins, extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third party software, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="_visitorstoourusersmembershipbots_"><em>Visitors to Our User`s Membership Bots</em></h4>
        <p>We also process information about visitors and clients of our users’ membership bots, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their membership bots isn’t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.</p>
        <h3 id="privacypolicychanges">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, BeastlyBot may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. BeastlyBot encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <a href="https://beastly.app/privacy">beastly.app/privacy</a>.

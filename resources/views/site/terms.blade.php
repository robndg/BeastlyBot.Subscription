                <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees.</strong> By using our Paid Services, you agree to pay the specified fees, which we'll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time on the account subscriptions page.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.</li>
                <!--<li><strong>Refunds.</strong> You may request a refund at any time from the subscriptions page, this will notify the server owner. However, a refund is at the sole discretion of the server owner unless the Shop otherwise specified as "No Questions Asked" at the time of request and are within the refund time period specified. Our payment processor will issue the refund request right away to the bank, but funds may take 7-10 business days to be seen. BeastlyBot does not have any control over subscriptions and are only a mediary between the server owner and your payment, we can only help with a request for a refund. You will not be able to resubscribe to the same product for 30 days. Fees are non-refundable.</li>-->
                <li><strong>Refunds.</strong>You can request a refund anytime during the first period of your subscription. There are a few factors in-which decide what happens.
                  Every subscription refund is up to the discretion of the server owner, however if the shop says "No Questions Asked" and you are within their refund policy time-frame listed when your subscription will refund instantly.
                  If the server owner fails to refund the server owner can be punished. You can contact us at team@beasty.app.
                  However, if the refund policy is "by server owner discretion with reason" you can request anytime during your time of purchase-subscription refund term with a reason. Your best luck is to request during their refund policy timeline.
                  If the server has no refund policy (or you are outside the refund policy), you can request a refund at any time during the subscriptions first billing term with a reason.
                  The Beastly Bot cannot issue a refund for the server owner. Please trust who you are paying!<br>
                  Fees may be non-refundable. You cannot cancel a refund request. After issued, you will be removed immediately from the role. Refunds can take up to 10 days to make it back to your bank.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don't agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsubscribing.</strong> You may unsubscribe at any time in the account subscriptions page. This will terminate your subscription at the end of your period. Once unsubscribed you cannot request a refund and you cannot resubscribe for 30 days.</li>

                <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion. For a subscription to shop Live, you can request a refund within 7 days after first payment. You cannot cancel a refund request. After issued, your shop will turn back to Test and no longer viewable to users. Refunds can take up to 10 days to make it back to your bank. Re-subscribe any time! 
                <br>To refund a users subscription or service from your Shop accept the refund request notification made by the user. If you have selected "No Questions Asked" and do not accept the request we may take action towards your account, such as store deletion or store ban. Fees are non-refundable.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don't agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service.</li>

We issue all proof of purchase (IP address, user address, email, service, terms of service) to the bank to hopefully win. If won you will recieve 80% of the funds back. There is a $15 USD dispute charge that will be invoiced (Stripe issues this to us first) and a strike may increase future transaction fees. We may contact us to lower your future fees and resolve the dispute.</li>
